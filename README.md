# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Bug with Responsive Modifiers

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS with responsive modifiers. The issue is characterized by unexpected behavior in certain combinations of utility classes, particularly when applied responsively. The problem is intermittent and difficult to reproduce reliably, making debugging challenging. 

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as inconsistent rendering of elements depending on the screen size and the specific combination of Tailwind utility classes used.  It's suspected to be related to a conflict between the responsive modifiers (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.) and other classes, but the exact cause remains elusive.

## Reproduction

The reproduction steps are not consistently reliable due to the intermittent nature of the bug.  The `bug.js` file contains example code where the bug might appear. 

## Solution

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` attempts to resolve the inconsistency by using more explicit class names or refactoring the CSS to ensure better specificity. The approach taken may vary depending on the specific scenario and context.
